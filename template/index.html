                                <h2>Science and Software</h2>
                                <p class="strong"><i>Applying the scientific method to the Software Development Lifecycle</i></p>
                                <p>Lately I’ve been thinking more about the approaches and methodologies we use to develop software. With the introduction of terms such as <b>TDD</b> (Test Driven Development), <b>ATDD</b> (Acceptance Test Driven Development), <b>BDD</b> (Behaviour Driven Development), <b>Specification by Example, User Stories, User Journeys, etc, etc,</b> it’s easy to see why teams may be struggling with understanding and using these approaches. The introduction of these terms can sometimes see people getting hung up on definitions and forgetting that these approaches all have one thing in common. The intent is to build a common understanding between team members and stakeholders of different disciplines and knowledge or skill levels. All of the above approaches have a purpose and if understood and implemented well can be of real benefit.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Overarching these approaches, we also have the two software methodology juggernauts of Agile and Waterfall however, rather than focuses on these, what would development look like if we applied the scientific method to it?</p>
                                <p><strong><u>1. OBSERVATION | RESEARCH</u></strong></p>
                                <p>Before starting any project we need to know ‘What problem are we trying to solve’ and ‘Who are we solving it for’. Once we know the answers to these questions, we are then able to observe and collect information about the problem or our intended users. Our research can include things such as data analysis, market or competitor research, customer feedback or user interviews. At this stage it’s important to make sure we have both quantitative and qualitative data as well as using multiple sources to help negate the impact of bias and assumption. If we collect information from multiple sources we can make better hypotheses. At this stage we may also observe that our initial thoughts about the problem or user needs to be modified for greater impact or success.</p>
                                <p><strong><u>2.  HYPOTHESIS | DESIGN</u></strong></p>
                                <p>If we have a balanced mix of research, observation and information, it puts us in a really good place to make a hypothesis about what we’re building and how to build it. This can be thought of as design. Making a hypothesis about software is thinking about ‘If I change X, then I expect Y to happen’. X is the visible change, and Y is the consequence of that change. For example, ‘If I change this link to a button, then I expect more users to interact with it’. From this point, I then have something to measure in order to know how successful that change has been. Design could be thought of as the visual representation of my hypothesis whether that be UI, code, architecture or infrastructure.</p>
                                <p><strong><u>3. EXPERIMENT | BUILD & TEST</u></strong></p>
                                <p>During the experimentation phase, we start to build and test the change we are intending to make. Testing also allows us to modify our build as we discover more information about the change that we didn’t know before. We may also choose to build more than one experiment if we are wanting to measure the success of an A/B test. This phase is not to be underestimated in terms of the amount of information it can provide us and should also be considered dynamic, rather than static. The more rigorous and defined our observation (research) and hypothesis (design), the clearer the purpose of the experiment (building and testing) should be.</p>
                                <p><strong><u>4. ANALYSIS | MEASURE SUCCESS</u></strong></p>
                                <p>After the development or product team has done all their hard work, it’s then time for the push to production. It’s at this point, most teams stop and move onto the next thing with the only measure of success being that the code has made it into a production environment and is alive. But what about our hypothesis? We now need to see if what we thought would happen, happened or if we need to make further changes. Measuring the success of a change is critical to knowing what to do next and also provides us with more information about what went well and where we went wrong. This analysis of what happens when we put our software in front of either part of or our entire user base can not only provide us information about what to do in the immediate future but can also gives us insight into what to focus on longer term.</p>
                                <p><strong><u>5. CONCLUSION | ITERATE</u></strong></p>
                                <p>By this stage we have a lot of information and because of our initial observation, hypothesis, experimentation and analysis, the conclusion about what to do next should be relatively clear. Do we need to perform any modifications or are further experiments required? Were we successful enough to leave this area of focus for now and move onto another one? Like any good life cycle, once we have reached our conclusion it’s time to start on the next iteration armed with more information and insights than we had before.</p>
                                <p>By treating software development in a more scientific way I find it easier to understand both what needs to be done and why.
                                </p>

                                <h2>The Team Experience</h2>
                                <p class="strong"><i>Creating a team experience using the principles of the user experience</i></p>
                                <p>When helping to create and deliver software, the user experience (UX) is at the core of my daily activities. It helps guide my questioning and decision making while helping to identify the value a product will bring when it’s being used.</p>
                                <p>I recently had the opportunity to speak at <a href="http://www.uxnewzealand.com"><u>UXNZ 2016</u></a> on the topic of applying the things I’ve learnt in UX to teams. I believe that the people behind the software, the creators, designers and analysts, are more interesting and more complex than what they produce.
                                    <p><i>“Great teams that are respectful to each other and work in a safe and supportive environment are more capable of building great things.”</i>
                                        <p><strong><u>Personas</u></strong>
                                            <p>Like most things, my story starts with the people. In UX, we use Personas to help create empathy and connect with who will be using our product. There is a trap that we can fall into when we start to classify people and that is the stereotype. In our workplaces, a lot of us have a title, something that helps others identify what our role is or what we are responsible for. When a group of people have the same title, it can be easy to assume that all of those people are alike. We assume that the people with the same title must all be the same because we can make sense of that. In short, it’s easier to think this way.
                                                <p>When we do this, comments like ‘Developers don’t like change’ or ‘Testers like breaking things’ or ‘Product Owners only care about deadlines’ start to be heard. This reinforces stereotypes and we lose the identity, skill and unique experience that the individuals in our teams bring. I don’t work with anyone called ‘Developer’ or ‘Tester’, there are people with names that do those types of activities and they should be recognised as the individuals they are. I like to think that addressing people by their titles is a way in which we distance ourselves from unkind remarks because we’re not frustrated with the person, we’re frustrated with the role that person plays. Unfortunately, in reality, the person being talked about can feel attacked, boxed in and restricted by their title or role. We give persona’s a name because it helps us to connect.
                                                    <p><strong><u>Prototypes</u></strong>
                                                        <p>The creation of prototypes enables us to gather feedback without the need to be production ready. Having something we can interact with makes it easier to identify any usability gaps and helps develop a clearer understanding of the vision for the product.
                                                            <p>Words only ever give us part of the picture and words can conjure up different images for different people based on their own experience or knowledge in a particular area. If I ask you to think of a vegetable, because that’s a broad category, it’s likely that we are both thinking of different vegetables. While your mental prototype might produce a carrot, mine could produce a cucumber because that was something I encountered earlier in the day. We are both thinking of a vegetable and are both technically correct but we have still failed to have a shared understanding of the same vegetable.
                                                                <p><i>Being explicit in our communication by using pictures as well as clarifying words, a shared understanding is easier to reach.</i>
                                                                    <p>When we are being implicit, gaps and ambiguity can creep in. We tend to jump to our own conclusions and understanding based on many of our own biases and beliefs that we hold. If unsure about the shared understanding of a word or idea, don’t be shy to ask ‘What does that mean to you?’.
                                                                        <p><strong><u>Measuring Success</strong></u>
                                                                            <p>In more recent times, improvements through iterations has become critical to a product’s success. Many companies have the ability to release code to production ‘when ready’ and users can have immediate access to those updates. When we first start to measure success, there are a lot of unknowns and sometimes a few nasty surprises when we find out we’re not doing quite as well as we thought we were. The natural reaction to something we don’t want to see is to make it go away. I call this the ‘box factor’. When opening a present on christmas morning we are usually either pleased because the gift in the box meets our expectations or we are disappointed because it doesn’t. One of these gifts will be opened while the other will probably remain in the closed box, left to gather dust.
                                                                                <p><i>When measuring success, it’s important to be transparent and accepting of both favourable and unfavourable possibilities.</i>
                                                                                    <p>At all times we expect the outcome to indicate either success or that there is still some more work to be done, that improvements are required. This approach means that there are no nasty surprises hiding in the box because we have been transparent about the possible outcomes. Reducing the impact of the surprise of an unfavourable outcome allows us to respond from a more measured and less reactive place.
                                                                                        <p><strong><u>Empathy</u></strong>
                                                                                            <p>Underpinning everything we do should be empathy, an understanding for our fellow humans. Empathy is the ability to connect with another person by understanding their point of view and recognising emotional responses. During my time in product development, I’ve picked up on four regularly said anti-empathic statements:
                                                                                                <p><b><ul class="list-inline">
																		<li>“At least they can…”</li>
																		<li>“There’s a workaround for…”</li>
																		<li>“Don’t worry, it’s just an edge case”</li>
																		<li>“We'll get that for free”</li></b></ul>
                                                                                                    <p>Hearing any of these in a review or product meeting immediately raises red flags for me and makes me re look at the solution in front of us. It’s a great indicator that there is still more work to be done. These statements show that we have failed to understand not only our customer and their user goals, but also that throughout development, the team has failed to communicate or understand a shared vision. Creating gaps in the product gives users the space to become frustrated or to experience an unhandled error. We have failed to map out their entire journey and have left metaphorical rivers and no bridge to cross them with.
                                                                                                        <p>By finding new ways to connect with the people around us in our work places, we can help create environments that foster innovation and products people love to build and use.</p>

                                <h2>Adapting to change</h2>
                                <p class="strong"><i>Building resiliance in the ever changing world of tech</i></p>
                                <p>Working in tech has many challenges, one of those is the rate of change and how we respond and adapt to those changes. New languages and tools are constantly introduced and for some this can be a fearful time. I once heard that we don’t fear change as much as we fear loss and I personally believe that to be true. The phrase ‘people don’t like change’ is a misnomer for me as it doesn’t fit with my view of the world or reflect the progress (rate of change) we’ve seen in the past 150 years. Some change is born out of necessity however some is out of curiosity, frustration, pleasure or by accident.
                                    <p>Lately my world has been a veritable epic centre of change and this has forced me to apply introspection and really think about what is happening both externally and internally. This thinking also follows on from my last post about expectations and how these too can have an impact on how we perceive the world around us.
                                        <p><strong><u>Compromised Values</u></strong>
                                            <p>We all have a set of internal guides that help us to make decisions and sense of the world. These are often referred to as a values, the emotive elements of life that we place a varying degree of importance on. For example, Integrity is one of my highest rated values whereas safety is something I value much less. This can be seen in my frustration with people I would consider unreliable and my ease at which I can pack up and move to another country without first securing a job. These are some of the things that make me, me. Everyone has their own set of values and their own ranking of these. If I propose the idea of packing up and moving overseas without a job and somewhere to live to someone that does value safety highly, I’m likely to meet quite a lot of resistance to this idea and probably a lot of questions.
                                                <p>When our values feel compromised in any way it’s likely that we will start to feel anxious, uncertain, frustrated and other things that make us feel a little uncomfortable with what’s happening around us. By knowing what our values are and taking the time to identify how something is making us feel, whether our values are being compromised or fulfilled, we can start to understand our own behaviours. This can help us to rationalise change and is a technique I find particularly useful when I feel as though the change is out of my control.
                                                    <p><strong><u>Fear of Loss</u></strong>
                                                        <p>Loss can be an incredibly powerful emotion and I know that times in which I’ve been most troubled has been when I’ve lost someone or something that I had a strong connection to. When we’re first confronted with losing something it can be a difficult time. A role change can stir up many varied emotions, such as being excited about new responsibilities or opportunities but it can also be a difficult time as we come to terms with perhaps losing team relationships that we had built up over time. With almost every state transition we take as people we are usually gaining something but in the process, also removing or losing something.
                                                            <p>In times of change where a feeling of loss has been involved I have found it helpful to focus on what I have gained. Being able to come to a place of accepting that things won’t be the same as they were can be difficult and it’s important that we are honest about ourselves as been accepting of a loss or not accepting. Some losses can feel bigger than others so I also like to use a scale system to put things in perspective.
                                                                <p><b><ul class="list-inline">
                                	<li>On a scale of 1 to 10, how much of an impact is this loss going to be on my life?</li>
                                	<li>What would be a 10?</li>
                                	<li>What other options do I still have?</li>
                                	<li>Is it still ‘X’ on the scale?</li></ul></b>
                                                                    <p>This exercise helps me to think of events more critically and I usually end up downgrading the impact of the loss by the end of this.
                                                                        <p><strong><u>Unmet Expectations</u></strong>
                                                                            <p>Most of us have an expectation about what is going to happen to us in the next day, the next week or for those of us who really love to think ahead, perhaps longer than that. If we’re the type of person who likes to think about the future and what that might bring given our current set of circumstances, when one of those circumstances change, this can throw things in to disarray. There is thinking that if you change your expectation, you change your perception. When people don’t met our expectations, even when we haven’t communicated what those expectations are, it’s easy to feel disappointed or frustrated that someone else hasn’t done what you think they should. Talking with people who have leadership positions about people who report to them, one of the common complaints is ‘Why did they / didn’t they do what I thought they would?’
                                                                                <p>The answer to this question lies in the conversation about what is or isn’t expected, not what you perceive the expectation to be. My perception is that most people want to be kind to other people and want to do well. Once a conversation takes place about what both parties expected, the source of frustration is usually clear. Having a growth mind set also helps with this as it allows us to be more open to other possibilities. This isn’t a case of ‘lowering expectations’ rather than ‘understanding expectations’ so that an outcome which is shared by both parties can be reached. Having the courage to talk about what we expect with others is a skill which I am continuing to place more importance on. It can be a good tool in diffusing a frustrating or difficult situation.
                                                                                    <p>Underlying a lot of this is ‘the unknown’ which, if not understood can sometimes cause paralysis of change. These are some of the types of change I commonly experience and how I try to adapt to the undulation of emotions that come with these events. The more practice I do with these tools, the quicker I am able to get back to a place of comfort where I feel empowered to act.</p>
